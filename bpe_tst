Tw ink le, twink le, little star , 
How I wonder what you ar e! 
U p above the world so high, 
Li ke a di am ond in the sk y. 

When the blazing sun is gone, 
When he nothing shin es up on, 
Then you show your little light, 
Tw ink le, twink le, all the night. 

Then the tra v ' ll er in the dark, 
Th an ks you for your tin y spar k, 
He could not see which way to go, 
If you did not twink le so.
